While this is a common distinction made by adult speakers, as well as older children, when children first begin to understand this distinction is an important open question in child language research. Specifically, it is important because it is one of the first times that children learn to combine words and , including new words that they have never heard before: if an object is called 'a wug', then two of those things are called 'wugs'. While children end up learning many such rules, this may be the first one, so it is important to learn when they start to understand it in speech from others, as well as how they use it in their own speech.<br><br> Previous studies point to a surprising result:  English-learning children use the plural in their own speech (like in the storybook) before they 'understand' it -- that is, can successfully identify what a speaker is talking about (like in the videos here).  The key to this counter-intuitive result may be that children can use the plural to identify what a speaker is talking about  <i>only</i>  when there are other parts of the sentence that correspond to number ('there <b>are</b> <b>two</b> dogs'), and it might take them a while to learn that the presence of an 's' indicates the plural. This would mean that children are learning grammar first, then using that to learn the sound system! This is backwards from what researchers first thought (children learn sounds, then words, then grammar).
